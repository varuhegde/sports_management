This has been however not only conceived but achieved at the Karnataka Lingayat Education Society, Belagavi over a century ago, when seven teachers fondly remembered as the 'Saptharishis' laid the foundation stone of the first Anglo-Indian school in the year 1916.The century long journey has seen an enormous growth of the KLE society from a sole sapling into a mammoth canopy of 216 Institutions spanning across education and health care services in a vivid array of geographies in India.</p>

This endeavor of the KLE society received further fillip when Dr. Prabhakar Kore took over the reins of chairmanship in the year 1985. His commendable leadership of 27 years is an example that each of the society's 11,170 members, 83,420 students and 9953 faculty members would like to emulate in their lives. </p>
